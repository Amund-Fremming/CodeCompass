# Transactions and Concurrency in Relational Databases

Transactions and concurrency control are essential aspects of relational databases that ensure data consistency, integrity, and isolation in multi-user environments. These concepts are critical for maintaining the reliability of databases while allowing multiple users to access and manipulate data simultaneously.

## Transactions

A **transaction** is a sequence of one or more database operations that are executed as a single unit of work. The concept of a transaction is often summarized by the acronym ACID:

- **Atomicity:** A transaction is atomic, meaning it's treated as a single indivisible unit. Either all the changes within a transaction are applied, or none of them are. This prevents partial updates that could leave the database in an inconsistent state.

- **Consistency:** Transactions bring the database from one consistent state to another. They must adhere to predefined rules and constraints, maintaining data integrity.

- **Isolation:** Transactions occur in isolation from each other, as if they are the only ones being executed. This prevents interference between transactions and ensures that their effects don't overlap.

- **Durability:** Once a transaction is committed, its changes are permanent and will survive system failures.

## Concurrency Control

**Concurrency control** refers to the management of multiple transactions that are executed concurrently by different users or processes. Ensuring data integrity in such scenarios is complex due to potential issues like:

- **Lost Updates:** When two transactions simultaneously update the same data, one update might overwrite the other, resulting in lost data.

- **Dirty Reads:** A transaction reads data that has been modified by another transaction but not yet committed, leading to incorrect results.

- **Uncommitted Data:** A transaction reads data modified by another transaction that has not been committed, causing inconsistency.

- **Inconsistent Retrievals:** A transaction reads different values of the same data within a single transaction due to other concurrent updates.

To manage these challenges, databases use techniques like locks, timestamps, and isolation levels to control how transactions interact with each other.

## Isolation Levels

Relational databases offer different **isolation levels** to control the visibility of changes made by other transactions. Common isolation levels include:

- **Read Uncommitted:** Allows transactions to read uncommitted changes made by other transactions. This offers the highest level of concurrency but can lead to dirty reads and inconsistent data.

- **Read Committed:** Ensures that transactions only read committed changes, preventing dirty reads. However, it can still lead to non-repeatable reads.

- **Repeatable Read:** Guarantees that if a transaction reads a value, it will see the same value throughout the transaction. Prevents dirty and non-repeatable reads but can lead to phantom reads.

- **Serializable:** Provides the highest level of isolation by preventing all concurrency-related anomalies. However, it can impact performance due to increased locking.

## Conclusion

Transactions and concurrency control are essential for maintaining data integrity and consistency in relational databases, especially in multi-user environments. By ensuring that transactions are atomic, consistent, isolated, and durable (ACID), databases can handle concurrent operations while maintaining data integrity. Choosing the appropriate isolation level is crucial to strike a balance between data integrity and performance in various application scenarios.
